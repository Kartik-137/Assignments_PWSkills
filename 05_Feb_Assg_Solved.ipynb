    "#### Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "- **Class** is a way of organizing information about a data type which gives access to the programmer to reuse the elements of the same when multiple instances of the data type is created. Class defines a general behavior that a whole category of instances created based on the class will have.\n",
    "- An **object** is an instance of the class and has the same general behavior as that of the class. All individual objects has three basic characteristics:\n",
    "    1. Identity: Allows objects to be differentiated from other objects.\n",
    "    2. State: The property an object has. (Eg. A variable's value can be manipulated) \n",
    "    3. Behavior: The actions that the objects can take.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- In OOP, classes represent real world things and the objects are based on them. Once an object is created, it is equipped with the general behavior defined for the class of that object.\n",
    "- Example of real world classes and their objects:\n",
    "    1. If Dog is class then all type of breeds are the object of the class Dog\n",
    "    2. If particle is a class then electrons, protons, quarks are the objects of the class particle\n",
    "    3. If Star is a class then red giant, dwarf stars, neutron stars, pulsars are the objects of the class Star"

    "#### Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "- The four pillars of Object Oriented Programming are as followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Abstraction:\n",
    "- Abstrsaction in OOPs is the concept using which a programmer can hide the internal functionality or the details of the function. \n",
    "- That is the internal working of the function remains hidden from the user and only the basic overview of the function is available to the user. \n",
    "- Therefore, the user only knows **what the function does** but does not know **how it does it**.\n",
    "- In heirarchy, abstraction lets parent classes put restriction over child classes\n",
    "- In python, a class is an abstract class if it contains one or more abstract methods. Here, first the parent class inherits the ABC class and then an abstract method inside the parent class is defined using the decorator __@abstractmethod__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Encapsulation:\n",
    "- Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping of data and methods that works on the data within one unit.\n",
    "- It lets a programmer put restriction over global access to methods and variables of the class. Therefore, it maintains data flow and prevents any accidental modification.\n",
    "- In python data can be encapsulated by prefixing the attributes and methods with:\n",
    "    1. single underscore ( _ ) to create **protected** members:\n",
    "    - Does not make any difference in the compiler side but conveys the programmer that data should not be accessed or modified   directly outside of the class.\n",
    "    2. double underscore ( __ ) to create **private** members:\n",
    "    - This makes the data private and hence can  only be accessed through intermediaries (getters and setters) if they are available.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 3. Polymorphism:"

    "- Polymorphism means having many forms.In programming, polymorphism is the concept in which the same function behaves differently based on the input data types.\n",
    "- Polymorphism allows the same function carrying the same name to be used for different tasks as if it was referring to altogether a different class. \n",
    "- Polymorphism has three main concepts: \n",
    "    1. Method overriding:\n",
    "        - Happens when parent class and child class has same methods and calling the methods through child' s object results in excution of child' s method instead of prioritizing parent' s method.\n",
    "    2. Method overloading:\n",
    "        - When the methods inside a class has the same name but differs on the basis of the arguments given and thus results in different output.\n",
    "        - Python does not support method overloading\n",
    "    3. Operator overloading:\n",
    "        - Another type of polymorphism where the operator behaves diffrently based on the operands given.\n",
    "        - For example (+) operator adds two integers but also performs concatenation of strings."

    "#### 4. Inheritance:\n",
    "- The concept of inheritance comes from biology itself, which gives the capability to the derived classes to acquire the traits, properties of their parent classes. The main idea behind inheritance is that one can create new classes based on existing classes.\n",
    "- Inheritance is beneficial for code reusabillity and makes the code reliable\n",
    "- Types of inheritance:\n",
    "    1. Single inheritance:\n",
    "    - child class has single parent class to inherit from.\n",
    "    2. Multi-level inheritance\n",
    "    - A chain of inheritance is present where the child class can inherit from all the Superclasses.\n",
    "    3. Hierarchical inheritance:\n",

    "- The constructor is function which does not require explicit calling and its control is not at the user' s hand. It is used for writing configuration related code."
