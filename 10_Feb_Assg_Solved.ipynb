    "#### Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "- Files can be opened using the **open()** in python. It creates a file handler object which then can be used for further manipulations\n",
    "- Files can be opened in the following different modes:\n",
    "    1. Read only ('r')\n",
    "        - Opens a text file for reading only.\n",
    "        - 'rb' for opening the binary file in reading mode.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Write only ('w')\n",
    "        - Opens the text file for writing content into it.\n",
    "        - 'wb' for opening the binary file in writing mode.\n",
    "    3. Create ('x')\n",
    "        - Creates a new file and opens the file in writing mode\n",
    "        \n",
    "    4. Append only ('a')\n",
    "        - Opens the file in writing mode.\n",
    "        - Unlike the 'w' mode which overwrites the previous content in the file, the 'a' mode puts the handle at the end of file thus adding the content at the end and the previous content remains unchanged."
